# Bar Replay and Debug Launcher
A simple debug launcher for testing engines, lobbies and games, and for playing replays.

## Associating replays to auto-start on double click

Right click any replay in your BAR/data/demos folder, and and set the "Open With" to "bar_demo_debug_launcher.exe". You can now double-click any replay and it should download all that is needed and start the replay!.

## Choosing a replay and starting it directly

Click the "Open and launch a replay" button, select it, and it should be loaded.
